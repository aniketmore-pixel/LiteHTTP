![LiteHTTP Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/LiteHTTP-C++-blue?style=flat-square)

**LiteHTTP** is a lightweight, multithreaded HTTP server written in C++. It serves static files efficiently using an **LRU cache** and a **thread pool**, designed for demonstration, experimentation, and benchmarking. The server uses **non-blocking I/O with epoll** for high concurrency.

## Features

-  **Multithreaded** request handling using a configurable thread pool  
-  **LRU cache** for small static files (<256KB) to improve response speed  
-  **Non-blocking I/O** using `epoll` for high concurrency  
-  **HTTP/1.1 compliant** with default keep-alive support  
-  **Thread-safe logging** with timestamps and optional color coding  
-  Lightweight and portable â€” runs smoothly in **Linux environments**, including Gitpod  
-  Automatic handling of `/` â†’ serves `index.html`

## Requirements

- C++17 or higher  
- Linux or Unix-based OS (Ubuntu, Gitpod, etc.)  
- Build tools: `g++`, `make`  
- Network access for port binding  

---

## Installation & Running

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LiteHTTP.git
cd LiteHTTP
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
make
```

3. Run the server:
```bash
./server 8080 www
```

4. Open in browser (Gitpod):
```bash
   The URL format will be:  https://8080-<workspace-id>.gitpod.io
```

## Server Usage
- Navigate to the server URL in a browser to see index.html.
- Requests to other static files in www/ are cached automatically using LRUCache.
- Supports simultaneous connections using ThreadPool.
- Logs provide real-time visibility of server activity.

## Logging & Monitoring
- **Thread-safe, timestamped logs in the terminal**  
- **Color-coded for clarity:**
  - ðŸ”µ **Blue** â†’ Startup / Shutdown
  - ðŸ”µ **Cyan** â†’ New client accepted
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow** â†’ Incoming requests
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green** â†’ Responses sent
  - ðŸ”´ **Red** â†’ Errors
