# LiteHTTP â€“ Multithreaded C++ HTTP Server

![LiteHTTP Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/LiteHTTP-C++-blue?style=flat-square)

**LiteHTTP** is a lightweight, multithreaded HTTP server written in C++. It serves static files efficiently using an **LRU cache** and a **thread pool**, designed for demonstration, experimentation, and benchmarking. The server uses **non-blocking I/O with epoll** for high concurrency.

## Features

-  **Multithreaded** request handling using a configurable thread pool  
-  **LRU cache** for small static files (<256KB) to improve response speed  
-  **Non-blocking I/O** using `epoll` for high concurrency  
-  **HTTP/1.1 compliant** with default keep-alive support  
-  **Thread-safe logging** with timestamps and optional color coding  
-  Lightweight and portable â€” runs smoothly in **Linux environments**, including Gitpod  
-  Automatic handling of `/` â†’ serves `index.html`

---

## Requirements

- C++17 or higher  
- Linux or Unix-based OS (Ubuntu, Gitpod, etc.)  
- Build tools: `g++`, `make`  
- Network access for port binding  

---

## Installation & Running

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LiteHTTP.git
cd LiteHTTP
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
make
```

3. Run the server:
```bash
./server 8080 www
```

4. Open in browser (Gitpod):
```bash
   The URL format will be:  https://8080-<workspace-id>.gitpod.io
```

## Server Usage
- Navigate to the server URL in a browser to see index.html.
- Requests to other static files in www/ are cached automatically using LRUCache.
- Supports simultaneous connections using ThreadPool.
- Logs provide real-time visibility of server activity.

## Logging & Monitoring
- **Thread-safe, timestamped logs in the terminal**  
- **Color-coded for clarity:**
  - ðŸ”µ **Blue** â†’ Startup / Shutdown
  - ðŸ”µ **Cyan** â†’ New client accepted
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow** â†’ Incoming requests
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green** â†’ Responses sent
  - ðŸ”´ **Red** â†’ Errors

## File Overview

#### include/cache.h
- Implements a **simple LRU cache** for files smaller than 256KB.  
- Stores recently accessed files to **reduce disk reads**.

#### include/thread_pool.h
- Implements a **thread pool** with a task queue.  
- Handles **multiple requests concurrently** using worker threads.

#### include/http.h & src/http.cpp
- Defines `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse` structures.  
- Contains functions for **parsing HTTP requests** and **building HTTP response headers**.

#### src/main.cpp
- Main server logic:  
  - Creates a **non-blocking TCP socket**.  
  - Uses **epoll** for efficient event-driven I/O.  
  - Handles client connections and HTTP requests using the **thread pool**.  
  - Serves **static files** from `www/` with **LRU caching**.  
  - Logs activity with **timestamps and color coding**.

#### www/index.html
- Sample homepage to demonstrate **static file serving**.


## Future Enhancements
- Dynamic content support (APIs)
- HTTPS / TLS support
- MIME type detection for different file types
- Configurable logging levels
- Detailed benchmarking & performance metrics
