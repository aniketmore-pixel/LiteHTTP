Features

âœ… Multithreaded request handling using a configurable thread pool.

âœ… LRU caching for small static files (<256KB) to improve response speed.

âœ… Non-blocking I/O using epoll for high concurrency.

âœ… HTTP/1.1 compliant with keep-alive support.

âœ… Thread-safe logging with timestamps and optional color-coding for demonstration.

âœ… Lightweight and portable â€” runs smoothly in Linux environments, including Gitpod.

Requirements

C++17 or higher

Linux or Unix-based environment (Gitpod, Ubuntu, etc.)

Standard build tools: g++, make

Network access for port binding

Installation & Running

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LiteHTTP.git
cd LiteHTTP


Build the project using Makefile:

make


Run the server:

./server 8080 www


8080 â†’ Port number (optional, default 8080)

www â†’ Document root directory (optional, default www)

Open in browser:

Gitpod automatically exposes port 8080. Click Ports â†’ Open Browser.

URL format: https://8080-<workspace-id>.gitpod.io

Usage

Navigate to the server URL in your browser to see index.html.

Refresh or request other files in www/ to test caching and multithreaded handling.

Logs appear in real-time in the terminal:

[15:30:10] âœ… Accepted new client: fd=6
[15:30:10] ðŸ“„ Request received: GET /index.html
[15:30:10] âœ… Response sent to fd=6 (status: 200)


Supports simultaneous connections using the ThreadPool.

Logging & Monitoring

Terminal logs: Timestamped, color-coded messages for:

Server startup/shutdown

Client connections

Requests and responses

Errors and exceptions

Optional file logging: Writes to server.log for persistent record.

Demo Screenshots

âœ… Server startup and accepted client logs:

[15:23:42] ðŸš€ Starting LiteHTTP on port 8080
[15:23:45] âœ… Accepted new client: fd=5
[15:23:46] ðŸ“„ Request received: GET /index.html
[15:23:46] âœ… Response sent to fd=5 (status: 200)


âœ… Browser displaying index.html:

Multithreaded HTTP server (C++)

Future Enhancements

Support for dynamic content and APIs

HTTPS support with TLS/SSL

Improved MIME type handling

Configurable logging verbosity

Detailed benchmarking tools
